# Backend TODOs — surfaced from frontend integration questions

Follow-ups surfaced during the review in `OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`. Solo-dev punch list; prioritised by risk.

## P0 — Correctness / money-safety

### ~~Idempotency coverage is incomplete~~ ✅ Done
Extended `idempotent` middleware to all financial-write endpoints. Done-by commit for this item noted inline:

- [x] `POST /invoices` (apiResource + cancel/post-to-gl/credit-note)
- [x] `POST /invoices/{id}/send`
- [x] `POST /payments`
- [x] `POST /bills` (apiResource + approve/cancel)
- [x] `POST /bills/{id}/payments`
- [x] `POST /payroll/{id}/calculate|approve|mark-paid`
- [x] `POST /eta/documents/{invoice}/submit|cancel`
- [x] `POST /subscription/change-plan`
- [x] `POST /import`, `POST /import/clients`, `POST /import/accounts`, `POST /import/opening-balances`
- [x] Also extended to `journal-entries` (apiResource + reverse + post) since misposting is expensive to undo
- [x] Regression test added at `tests/Feature/IdempotencyMiddlewareTest.php` (5 assertions: no-key pass-through, replay preserves status, bad-UUID 422, GET skipped, failed responses not cached)

### ~~2FA flow does not match docs~~ ✅ Done (option a)
Login response now includes `requires_2fa: bool`. True when user is admin/super-admin without 2FA enabled — exactly matches `Enforce2fa` middleware's gating condition, so the login flag and the downstream 403 stay in sync. Token remains full-access; non-admins bypass the flag entirely.

- [x] `AuthController::login()` returns `data.requires_2fa`
- [x] `docs/features/01-authentication.md` rewritten to describe actual behavior (flag semantics, no token scoping)
- [x] 3 regression tests in `AuthTest.php` (admin w/o 2FA → true; admin w/ 2FA → false; non-admin → false)

Option (b) — token scoping + per-session verification — deferred. Current model is "once 2FA enabled, always allowed" which is weaker than per-session verification but matches what the `Enforce2fa` middleware actually enforces. If per-session verification becomes a requirement (e.g. for SOC2), revisit this with a new ticket.

### ~~E-commerce webhook has no signature verification~~ ✅ Done
Route changed to `POST /webhooks/ecommerce/{platform}/{channel}` — channel id identifies tenant + webhook_secret. New `VerifyEcommerceWebhookSignature` middleware rejects unsigned / wrong-signature / inactive-channel requests with 401.

- [x] Middleware at `app/Http/Middleware/VerifyEcommerceWebhookSignature.php` registered as `ecommerce.verify`
- [x] Platform schemes wired:
  - Shopify: `X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256` base64 HMAC-SHA256
  - WooCommerce: `X-WC-Webhook-Signature` base64 HMAC-SHA256
  - Salla: `X-Salla-Signature` hex HMAC-SHA256
  - Zid: `X-Zid-Signature` hex HMAC-SHA256
  - Custom: always rejected (use an authenticated endpoint for self-hosted integrations)
- [x] Webhook secret stored encrypted on `ECommerceChannel.webhook_secret` (was already there)
- [x] 11 regression tests cover: valid-per-platform, wrong-sig, missing-sig, missing-secret, unknown-channel, platform-mismatch, inactive-channel, custom rejection
- [x] Middleware binds `tenant.id` and exposes verified channel via `$request->attributes->get('ecommerce_channel')` for downstream handlers

Known gap: the actual event-processing logic in `ECommerceService::webhookHandler` is still placeholders — signatures are now verified, but order records aren't yet created from webhook payloads. Separate ticket when real sync is implemented.

## P1 — Gaps blocking clean frontend integration

### ~~`/v1/me` missing `tenant.features`~~ ✅ Done
`/v1/me` now returns `data.tenant.features` as a `{key: bool}` map covering every flag defined in the `feature_flags` table, with per-tenant overrides merged in. The plan id is resolved from the tenant's active (or trial) subscription, so plan-bundled flags light up correctly.

- [x] `AuthController::me()` calls `FeatureFlagService::getAllForTenant($tenantId, $planId)` via a private helper
- [x] `FeatureFlagService` already caches the merged map per tenant for 5 minutes — `/me` polling won't thrash the DB
- [x] Regression test in `AuthTest.php` asserts the map structure + merge semantics with one globally-enabled and one globally-disabled flag
- [x] Docs updated in `docs/features/01-authentication.md` — noted that `features` is included on `tenant`

### ~~Permissions missing from backend~~ ✅ Done
Added `manage_engagements`, `manage_approvals`, `manage_alerts` to `config/permissions.php`. The routes already referenced these slugs (`routes/api.php:661,883,896`) but the slugs weren't defined anywhere, so `CheckPermission` middleware was denying non-super-admins. Now they seed correctly.

- [x] `manage_engagements` → admin + accountant
- [x] `manage_approvals` → admin + accountant
- [x] `manage_alerts` → admin only (alerts are a platform-ops concern, not day-to-day accounting)
- [x] `manage_reports` → **not added.** Reports are read-only for tenant users today; `view_reports` covers the existing behavior. When report templates/schedules become user-editable, re-evaluate. Frontend should drop `manage_reports` from `app/core/rbac/permissions.ts`.

Seeder is config-driven — `php artisan db:seed --class=PermissionSeeder --force` on deploy picks them up. Existing tenants with pre-assigned roles need a re-sync: run the seeder on the production DB once.

### ~~Role-to-permission preset endpoint~~ ✅ Done
`GET /v1/rbac/role-presets` returns the admin/accountant/auditor preset maps directly from `config('permissions')`, gated by `permission:manage_team`. Includes English + Arabic labels so the frontend can render a bilingual dropdown without a second translation fetch.

Response shape:
```json
{
  "data": [
    { "role": "admin", "label": "Administrator", "label_ar": "مدير", "permissions": [...] },
    { "role": "accountant", "label": "Accountant", "label_ar": "محاسب", "permissions": [...] },
    { "role": "auditor", "label": "Auditor", "label_ar": "مراجع", "permissions": [...] }
  ]
}
```

- [x] `RbacController::rolePresets` + route at `api.php`
- [x] 2 tests in `tests/Feature/RbacPresetsTest.php` (happy path + permission rejection)

---

## P2 — Consistency / polish

### ~~Canonical bulk-response pattern~~ ✅ Done
`POST /api/v1/ecommerce/bulk-convert` now returns **201 Created** when every order converts cleanly and **206 Partial Content** when at least one fails — matching the document bulk-upload semantics. Body shape is unchanged (`{data: {converted, errors}}`), so any frontend that already reads counts keeps working; new code can branch on status alone.

- [x] Controller patched in `ECommerceController::bulkConvert`
- [x] Regression test added for the 201 happy path

### Magic-link invite for portal users (§2.1)
Today portal users are created with `Hash::make(Str::random(16))` and must use the password-reset flow to sign in — poor UX for an invited client.

- [ ] Add a signed, single-use invite-link token (e.g. `POST /v1/portal/accept-invite` that accepts the token and lets the user set their password in one step).
- [ ] Include the signed URL in the welcome email from `ClientInvitationService::sendWelcome()`.

### Messaging `throttle:10,1` may be too low (§5.2)
10 sends/min per user is tight for an accounting firm with heavy reminder workflows.

- [ ] Consider raising to 30–60/min OR defining a named `messaging` limiter with per-tenant quota (e.g. 200/min/tenant). Only if user feedback confirms — don't pre-optimize.
